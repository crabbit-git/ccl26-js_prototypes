# What's this then?

It's a wee practice exercise designed to familiarise with how constructors and prototypes work in JavaScript. Specifically, it's some models that might be used to build a simple transaction tracker / categoriser for keeping an eye on what users spend money on. That's pretty much it. It's not a working application or anything, just some models and a `runner.js` to throw some code around in that tests those models out.

If you want to mess with it, make sure you've got [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, clone this repository, and run `node runner.js` from the root of the repository in a terminal. You can have a nosey through the models and then try setting up some instances of Tag, Merchant, Transaction, and Account, then manipulate those as you fancy. There isn't really much else to it.

Oh, and there's no formal licence for this, so just don't blame me if you mess up your computer or whatever. Ta!
